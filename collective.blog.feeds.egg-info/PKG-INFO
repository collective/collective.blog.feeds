Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.blog.feeds provides blog feeds for standard Plone folders and
        collections. It builds on basesyndication and fatsyndication and uses their
        architecture and templates, but provides concrete implementations for
        standard Plone content.
        
        To create the feeds all you need to do is make collective.blog.feeds be a
        dependent product in your buildout, and include the ZCML one way or another.
        Plone folders, large folders and collections will then gain a set of new
        views: atom.xml, feed.rdf, feed11.rdf, rss.xml and itunes.xml.
        
        
        What this product do not have
        -----------------------------
        
        There is no Plone Control Panel in this product, nor will there ever be one,
        so you need to change the settings through the ZMI. There will also never be
        any per-folder settings, as that would require extending the schema for
        folders or have a dedicated blog type, both which will defeat the main goal
        of this product: simplicity and flexibility.
